            The largest of all sea turtles, and one of the largest reptiles on earth, the leatherback turtle ranges in size from 4-8 feet in length (1.2 - 2.4 meters) and weighs between 500-2,000 pounds (225 - 900 kg). The average adult measures in between 5-6 feet (1.5 - 1.8 m) and weighs 600-800 pounds (270 - 360 kg).

            The oldest of all sea turtle species, it has been around for more than 150 million years! They survived the extinction of the dinosaurs and thrived until the last several decades when human interactions have taken a major toll.

        <ul>
            <li> Leatherbacks can consume nearly their own body weight in prey per day (about 73% of their weight), feeding exclusively on soft-bodied invertebrates like jellyfish and tunicates. </li>
            <li> Leatherbacks are the deepest diving sea turtles, reaching depths of 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) in search of food. </li>
            <li> Leatherbacks are highly migratory, traveling thousands of miles between feeding and nesting grounds. Some individuals have been tracked traveling over 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometers) in a single year! </li>
            <li> Unlike other sea turtles, leatherbacks do not have a hard shell. Instead, their carapace is covered by a thick, leathery skin with embedded small bones called osteoderms. </li>
            <li> Leatherbacks have unique adaptations to help them survive in cold water, including a large body size, a thick layer of fat, and counter-current heat exchangers in their flippers. </li>
