           The green sea turtle is the second largest after the leatherback. They can weigh up to 500 lbs (225 kg) and reach four feet (1.2 m) in length. The adult is an herbivore, dining on sea grasses, seaweeds, algae and other forms of marine plant life. Their beak is sharp and finely serrated, perfectly adapted for grazing in seagrass beds and scraping algae off of hard surfaces.

            This species is the only one to come on shore regularly to bask. Basking only occurs in Hawaii, particularly the Northwestern Hawaiian Island chain, the Galapagos Islands, and in some areas of Australia.

        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> These turtles are believed to improve the health of seagrass beds and associated microhabitats. They will graze the beds, taking off the tops of leaf blades, while avoiding the roots. The seagrass will grow healthier and faster with a daily trim! </li>
            <li> Some greens in the Eastern Pacific are considered Pacific black turtles and some researchers believe they may be a separate species as opposed to their current status as a sub-species. Their coloration is not black, but their skin pigmentation is darker than other green turtles, making them appear darker overall. They are also smaller and their carapace is slightly different in shape. </li>
            <li> Their name comes from the color of their fat, not their shell, as commonly believed. </li>
            <li> They are listed as Endangered in the US and around the world by the IUCN Red List. </li>
            <li> Their scientific name is Chelonia mydas </li>
        </ul>
